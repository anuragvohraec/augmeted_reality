# Augmented reality (AR)
Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience that combines the real world and computer-generated content.

# Light engine
A light engine, in the context of augmented reality (AR), is a term used to describe a component or system that generates and projects light in a controlled manner to create virtual images or augment the real-world environment. It's a critical part of AR devices like smart glasses or headsets.

# Display Unit
The display unit in augmented reality (AR) is the component of an AR system that presents the virtual content to the user. It's a critical part of the AR experience, as it's responsible for overlaying digital information onto the real-world environment. For example it could be reflective surface where the light engine projects the visual experience or any final surface onto which user sees to feel the AR experience.
